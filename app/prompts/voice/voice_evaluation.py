    ### Step 2: Answer Evaluation
    Evaluate the refined `answer_text` from Step 1 using the following criteria, scoring each from 0 to 10.
    For each score, always provide a clear rationale with at least three sentences explaining your assessment.
    **Note: If a candidate’s answer scores below 10, always give specific examples to illustrate which parts of their response did not meet expectations.**

    #### Evaluation Criteria
    a. **wpm (Words Per Minute)**: Was the provided speech rate (WPM) appropriate, allowing for clear and effective communication during the interview?
        0: Speech rate is completely off the acceptable range (≤100 WPM or ≥200 WPM), making the response nearly impossible to follow or understand.
        1-3: Speech rate is significantly outside the ideal range (101-120 WPM or 180-199 WPM), causing major issues in comprehension or delivery.
        4-7: Speech rate is slightly outside the ideal range (121-139 WPM or 161-179 WPM), causing minor disruptions but still understandable.
        8-10: Speech rate is perfectly within the ideal range (140-160 WPM), ensuring clear, professional, and effective communication throughout the response.

    b. **appropriate_response**: Does the answer address the question properly, considering the **{job_role}** role and job expectations?
        0: Completely off-topic; does not address the question in any way.
        1-3: Partially relevant, but lacks depth and misses key aspects of the role; the answer may be too generic.
        4-6: Satisfactory with some relevant points, but could include more details or focus on role-specific skills.
        7-8: Clear and relevant, addressing the question with a good understanding of the role.
        9-10: Highly relevant and demonstrates an in-depth understanding of both the question and role expectations.

    c. **logical_flow**: Does the answer follow a clear and logical structure that aligns with the question?
        0: No recognizable structure; thoughts are scattered or disorganized.
        1-3: Some structure, but lacks coherence or logical progression; ideas are present but hard to follow.
        4-6: Basic structure that conveys ideas, but could be clearer; minor improvements would enhance flow.
        7-8: Clear and logical, with a well-organized answer.
        9-10: Exceptionally well-structured and logical, with seamless flow and organization.

    d. **key_terms**: Are relevant technical or domain-specific terms used appropriately, in line with the question's intention and context?
        0: No relevant terms are used, or terms are misused.
        1-3: Few or incorrect terms; shows limited understanding of terminology.
        4-6: Some key terms are used but could be improved for accuracy or relevance.
        7-8: Well-chosen terms that suit the context and question.
        9-10: Excellent use of precise and contextually appropriate terms, enhancing the answer’s quality.

    e. **consistency**: Is the answer consistent with the candidate's overall responses and the expectations for this role?
        0: Completely inconsistent with prior responses or role expectations.
        1-3: Minor inconsistencies that detract from overall alignment.
        4-6: Mostly consistent, but with slight deviations from the expected responses.
        7-8: Fully consistent with role expectations and other responses.
        9-10: Completely aligned with role expectations and previous responses, demonstrating a cohesive understanding.

    f. **grammatical_errors(Korean grammar standards)**: Evaluate whether the answer is written in proper Korean grammar and syntax.
        0 points: Numerous grammatical and syntactical errors make the response difficult to understand.
        1-3 points: Frequent errors that make the response hard to read, though some parts are understandable.
        4-6 points: Some errors are present but do not significantly impede comprehension.
        7-8 points: Minor errors that do not affect the overall clarity of the response.
        9-10 points: Perfectly written with no noticeable errors.

    ### Step 3: Detailed Feedback and Suggestions
    Along with scoring, provide detailed feedback for the candidate’s answer based on the evaluations in STEP 1. Each category requires at least three sentences of rationale.
    **Note: For any score below 10, always include specific examples to explain which aspects led to the deduction.**

    #### Feedback Categories
    a. **strengths**: Highlight the candidate's strong points across both steps, focusing on how they excelled in key aspects of the response.
        - For **Step 1**: Identify areas where the candidate's speech rate, fluency, and pronunciation contributed positively to clarity and professionalism.
        - For **Step 2**: Emphasize how the response addressed key aspects of the question by clearly meeting the requirements, showcasing relevant skills, or providing insightful examples that enhanced the quality of the response.
    b. **improvement**: Identify any weaknesses or areas where the response could be improved, focusing on specific aspects of the evaluation criteria.
        - For **Step 1**: Highlight any issues related to the candidate's speech rate, fluency, or pronunciation that negatively impacted the clarity or professionalism of the response.
        - For **Step 2**: Pinpoint areas where the response fell short of addressing the question’s requirements, such as a lack of logical flow, insufficient use of key terms, or inconsistencies in the answer.
    c. **suggestion**: Provide clear, actionable steps the candidate could take to address the identified weaknesses and improve their response.
        - For **Step 1**: Suggest ways to enhance speech delivery, such as maintaining an appropriate speech rate, reducing hesitations, or improving pronunciation for clearer communication.
        - For **Step 2**: Recommend specific strategies to strengthen the response, such as improving logical flow, including relevant key terms, or adding more detailed and relevant examples to enhance the depth and relevance of the answer.

    ### Language and Format Requirements
    - Write all rationale and feedback sections in **Korean**, using formal language with sentence endings like **"~입니다" and "~것입니다"** to maintain a consistent, professional tone.
    - Avoid starting with terms like "candidate" or similar titles.
    - Limit comma usage to ensure clear and concise sentences.
