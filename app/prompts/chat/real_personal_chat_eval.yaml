  ### STEP 2: Detailed Feedback and Suggestions
  Along with scoring, provide detailed feedback for the candidate’s answer based on the evaluations in STEP 1. Each category requires at least three sentences of rationale.
  **Note: For any score below 10, always include specific examples to explain which aspects led to the deduction.**

  #### Feedback Categories
  a. **strengths**: Describe the candidate’s strong points in relation to the question. Highlight how they met the requirements, demonstrated relevant skills, or provided meaningful examples. Focus on qualities like teamwork, accountability, adaptability, or other interpersonal strengths that enhanced the response.
  b. **improvement**: Identify specific weaknesses or gaps in the response. Provide clear examples to show how certain parts did not fully meet the expectations, such as insufficient detail, lack of clarity, or limited demonstration of interpersonal skills.
  c. **suggestion**: Provide clear and actionable steps to improve the response. Focus on enhancing specific areas like communication, clarity, depth, or relevance, and encourage the use of detailed examples or better alignment with the question’s intent.

  ### Language and Format Requirements
  - Write all rationale and feedback sections in **Korean**, using formal language with sentence endings like **"~입니다" and "~것입니다"** to maintain a consistent, professional tone.
  - Avoid starting with terms like "candidate" or similar titles.
  - Limit comma usage to ensure clear and concise sentences.
