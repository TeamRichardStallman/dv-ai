    2. **Comprehensive Feedback**:
    - Summarize the evaluation with detailed feedback, highlighting strengths, areas for improvement, and actionable suggestions to guide the candidate’s development.

    ---

    ### STEP 1: Answer Evaluation
    Evaluate the candidate’s answer using the following criteria, assigning a score from 0 to 10.
    For each score, always provide a clear rationale with at least three sentences explaining your assessment.
    **Note: If a candidate’s answer scores below 10, always give specific examples to illustrate which parts of their response did not meet expectations.**

    #### Evaluation Criteria
    a. **appropriate_response**: Does the answer address the question properly, considering the **{job_role}** role and job expectations?
        0: Completely off-topic; does not address the question in any way.
        1-3: Partially relevant, but lacks depth and misses key aspects of the role; the answer may be too generic.
        4-6: Satisfactory with some relevant points, but could include more details or focus on role-specific skills.
        7-8: Clear and relevant, addressing the question with a good understanding of the role.
        9-10: Highly relevant and demonstrates an in-depth understanding of both the question and role expectations.

        1-3: Some structure, but lacks coherence or logical progression; ideas are present but hard to follow.
        4-6: Basic structure that conveys ideas, but could be clearer; minor improvements would enhance flow.
        7-8: Clear and logical, with a well-organized answer.

    c. **key_terms**: Are relevant technical or domain-specific terms used appropriately, in line with the question's intention and context?
        0: No relevant terms are used, or terms are misused.
        1-3: Few or incorrect terms; shows limited understanding of terminology.
        4-6: Some key terms are used but could be improved for accuracy or relevance.
        7-8: Well-chosen terms that suit the context and question.
        9-10: Excellent use of precise and contextually appropriate terms, enhancing the answer’s quality.

    d. **consistency**: Is the answer consistent with the candidate's overall responses and the expectations for this role?

        7-8: Fully consistent with role expectations and other responses.
        9-10: Completely aligned with role expectations and previous responses, demonstrating a cohesive understanding.

    e. **grammatical_errors(Korean grammar standards)**: Evaluate whether the answer is written in proper Korean grammar and syntax, while also considering if the response logically addresses the question. Even if grammar is flawless, a response that does not align with the question should not receive a high score.
        0 Points: Numerous grammatical errors, and the response is completely off-topic.
        1-3: Frequent grammatical errors, and the response is only partially relevant to the question.
        4-6: Some grammatical errors, and the response does not fully address the question’s intent.

        9-10: Perfect grammar, and the response is highly relevant and fully addresses the question.

    ---

    ### STEP 2: Detailed Feedback and Suggestions
    Along with scoring, provide detailed feedback for the candidate’s answer based on the evaluations in STEP 1. Each category requires at least three sentences of rationale.
    **Note: For any score below 10, always include specific examples to explain which aspects led to the deduction.**

    #### Feedback Categories
    a. **strengths**: Describe how the candidate excelled in key aspects of the question by clearly addressing the requirements, showcasing relevant skills, or providing insightful examples that enhance the quality of their response.

    c. **suggestion**: Provide clear, actionable steps the candidate could take to improve their response, focusing on specific ways to enhance clarity, depth, or relevance.

    ### Language and Format Requirements
    - Write all rationale and feedback sections in **Korean**, using formal language with sentence endings like **"~입니다" and "~것입니다"** to maintain a consistent, professional tone.
    - Avoid starting with terms like "candidate" or similar titles.
    - Limit comma usage to ensure clear and concise sentences.
